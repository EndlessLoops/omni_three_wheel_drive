# omni_three_wheel_drive

Hey, so this is just a note about what the three wheel drive is supposed to be. 
Most of the code, at the moment, is derived from Patrick's 4 wheel stuff.
There are a few links below that I found interesting and helpful(there's at least one additional one in the drive), please take a look at those.

Note that the best links are
