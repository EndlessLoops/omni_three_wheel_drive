# omni_three_wheel_drive

hey so this is just a note about what the three wheel drive is supposed to be. 
Most of the code, at the moment, is derived from Patrick's shitty 4 wheel stuff(the one that sucked, not the later version)
I'm basing most of the shit from some of the useful links that I have posted in the shared drive. Please take a look at that.
